            An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust
            from a jet engine, propeller, or rocket engine. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing
            configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and
            people, military, and research. Worldwide, commercial aviation transports more than four billion passengers
            annually on airliners[1] and transports more than 200 billion tonne-kilometers[2] of cargo annually, which
            is less than 1% of the world's cargo movement.[3] Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft,
            but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled such as drones.

        <h2>Etymology and usage</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            First attested in English in the late 19th century (prior to the first sustained powered flight), the word
            airplane, like aeroplane, derives from the French aéroplane, which comes from the Greek ἀήρ (aēr), "air"[6]
            and either Latin planus, "level",[7] or Greek πλάνος (planos), "wandering".[8][9] "Aéroplane" originally
            referred just to the wing, as it is a plane moving through the air.[10] In an example of synecdoche, the
            word for the wing came to refer to the entire aircraft.

            In the United States and Canada, the term "airplane" is used for powered fixed-wing aircraft. In the United
            Kingdom and most of the Commonwealth, the term "aeroplane" (/ˈɛərəpleɪn/[10]) is usually applied to these
            aircraft.

        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>
            stories from antiquity involve flight, such as the Greek legend of Icarus and Daedalus, and the Vimana in
            ancient Indian epics. Around 400 BC in Greece, Archytas was reputed to have designed and built the first
            artificial, self-propelled flying device, a bird-shaped model propelled by a jet of what was probably steam,
            said to have flown some 200 m (660 ft).[11][12] This machine may have been suspended for its flight.[13][14]

            Some of the earliest recorded attempts with gliders were those by the 9th-century Andalusian and
            Arabic-language poet Abbas ibn Firnas and the 11th-century English monk Eilmer of Malmesbury; both
            experiments injured their pilots.[15] Leonardo da Vinci researched the wing design of birds and designed a
            man-powered aircraft in his Codex on the Flight of Birds (1502), noting for the first time the distinction
            between the center of mass and the center of pressure of flying birds.
